## Goals
The platform is designed to:
- Enhance student engagement and motivation through interactive content and challenges.
- Provide immediate feedback and support to help students understand and retain information.
- Offer a personalized learning experience that adapts to the pace and style of each student.

## Development Phases
The project will be developed in three main sprints:
- **Sprint 1**: Focus on backend development for user management, quiz functionality, and data tracking.
- **Sprint 2**: Develop AI algorithms for personalized learning paths and instant tutoring.
- **Sprint 3**: Implement the frontend interface for students and teachers.
